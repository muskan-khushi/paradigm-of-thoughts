## 🌑 Overview

A bespoke digital experience developed for **Studio POT**, a luxury interior design firm based in Bengaluru. This platform serves as a digital archive, translating the studio's philosophy of minimalism and narrative-driven design into an interactive web environment.

The interface prioritizes negative space, cinematic rhythm, and tactile interaction, moving beyond standard commercial templates to create a gallery-like atmosphere.

## 🏛️ Design Systems

The application is built on three core aesthetic pillars:

* **🌊 Inertial Scrolling:** A momentum-based scroll system that gives the content weight and fluid movement, mimicking the feeling of a native application.
* **🎞️ Atmospheric Texture:** A subtle, algorithmic film grain overlay that removes digital flatness, providing a "printed" editorial quality to the dark mode interface.
* **✨ Contextual Interaction:** A custom cursor system that adapts to surface brightness and user intent, maintaining the brand's signature gold palette without compromising legibility.
* **🧭 Adaptive Navigation:** A "Smart Glass" header that retreats during exploration to maximize visual immersion and reappears intuitively upon upward movement.
